 Sweet Delights — Final POE 


- index.html — main single-page application (Home + Menu Management views)
- style.css — styling
- app.ts — TypeScript source (included)
- app.js — JavaScript (browser-ready)
- README.md, CHANGELOG.md — submission notes

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser or use VSCode Live Server.
2. Use the Manager screen to add/remove menu items. The Home screen shows averages per course.
3. The app persists menu items using localStorage.
4. In Part 3, I refactored my code to use TypeScript with functions, loops, and global variables. I added a new Menu Management screen for the chef to add/remove menu items, implemented average price calculations per course on the home screen, and added a course filter for the guest view. All data now persists using localStorage, and the code is organized into multiple reusable functions.
5.  Changes Since Part 2
- Moved add/remove feature to a new Menu Management screen.
- Added average price calculations per course.
- Added filtering by course for guests.
- Refactored code to use TypeScript functions and loops (for, while, for...of).
- Added global variable for menu items and saved data to localStorage.
- Improved code organization and readability.
