# Sweet Delights — Final POE (Single new website)

This project is a single-page site built to satisfy the Final POE requirements.
Files:
- index.html — main single-page application (Home + Menu Management views)
- style.css — styling
- app.ts — TypeScript source (included)
- app.js — JavaScript (browser-ready)
- README.md, CHANGELOG.md — submission notes

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser or use VSCode Live Server.
2. Use the Manager screen to add/remove menu items. The Home screen shows averages per course.
3. The app persists menu items using localStorage.

Recording instructions (for video):
- Show Home screen with averages.
- Filter by course (e.g., Starters) to demonstrate filtering.
- Open Menu Management, add a new item, show it appears on Home and averages update.
- Remove an item and show averages update.
